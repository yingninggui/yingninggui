### Hey, I'm Yingning ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo. On campus, I research HCI and invest in student founders with [**Contrary**](https://contrarycap.com/). This past summer, I interned at **Uber** as a [**Klenier Perkins Engineering Fellow**](http://fellows.kleinerperkins.com/).

Previously, I worked at [**Social Capital**](https://www.socialcapital.com/) and **Microsoft**, organized Hack the North, led various mentorship initatives for my program, and studied abroad in Singapore.

I also dabble a bit in photography and studied film for 4 years.

Always happy to chat - reach me at yingning.gui@uwaterloo.ca!
