### Hey, I'm Yingning ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently building products at **Uber**, as a [**Klenier Perkins Engineering Fellow**](http://fellows.kleinerperkins.com/), and investing in student founders with [**Contrary Capital**](https://contrarycap.com/). At the University of Waterloo, where I go to school, I study Software Engineering and research Human-Computer Interaction.

Previously, I interned at [**Social Capital**](https://www.socialcapital.com/) and **Microsoft**, organized Hack the North, led various mentorship initatives for my program, and studied abroad in Singapore.

I also dabble a bit in photography and studied film for 4 years.

Always happy to chat - reach me at yingning.gui@uwaterloo.ca!
