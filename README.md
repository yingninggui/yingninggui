### Hey, I'm Yingning 👋

I'm currently building products at Uber, as a Klenier Perkins Engineering Fellow, and investing in student founders with Contrary Capital. At the University of Waterloo, where I go to school, I study Software Engineering and research Human-Computer Interaction.

Previously, I interned at Social Capital and Microsoft, organized Hack the North, led various mentorship initatives for my program, and studied abroad in Singapore.

I also dabble a bit in photography and studied film for 4 years.
