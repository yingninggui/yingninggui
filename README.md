### Hey, I'm Yingning ðŸ‘‹

Currently exploring new things! Recently, I founded a startup backed by YC. Before that, I interned at [**Social Capital**](https://www.socialcapital.com/), **Uber** & **Microsoft**. At Waterloo, I helped run [**Hack the North**](https://hackthenorth.com/), invested with [**Contrary**](https://contrarycap.com/), and researched crisis informatics. 

In my spare time, I like to take photos, shoot video, and travel. I'm also interested in fintech, journalism, and the creator economy.
